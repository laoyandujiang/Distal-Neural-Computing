# Distal-Neural-Computing
A low-light imaging framework named Distal Neural Computing, which end-to-end optimizes the optical lens (Optical Neural Network) and digital post-processing model (Deep Learning Network).

This work is currently under review. The code is promised to be released at this repository after this work is published.
